Nolan Harless - Section 03 - Dr. Eloe / 10am

Hello, my name is Nolan Harless and I am a junior majoring in Computer Programming with an emphasis in Interactive Digital Media (IDM). I am from Kansas City, Missouri and have a strong background in front end web development and graphic design. I’ve interned at Cerner Corporation, Hallmark Cards, American Century Investments and other local small web/design firms in downtown Kansas City. 

My plans for the future are to secure a job somewhere within the design and tech field and hopefully get to work on front end web development, logo creation and branding. Something interesting about me is that I like to draw using pencil, ink, and markers. I have been thinking for the past few years that if college doesn’t work out for me I would work on becoming a tattoo artist.
